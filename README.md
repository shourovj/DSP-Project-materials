# Extracting Audio from Muted Video

In this project the main objective was to extract the audio signal from a muted video. For example let two people are chatting in a room and you want to hear what they are talking about but your are not even anywhere near the room. What you can do is place a high speed camera with a telephoto lens and foucs it to any object of the room. Then by applying signal processing methods the audio conversation can be recovered from the vibration of the objects from the video frames.
